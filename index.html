                <p>When Lord Ram returned to Ayodhya after completing fourteen years in exile, after he defeated Ravana by lighting rows of clay lamps. Since then, the festival of Diwali has been celebrated. People cover streets and buildings in festive lighting and there are lively songs and dance. Dazzling fireworks go off, creating a spectacle of noise and light. This helps to scare away evil spirits and celebrate the victory of good over evil. It is also known as festival of lights.  Families also perform Lakshmi Puja and pray to the Goddess of wealth to bless them with health, wealth, and prosperity.
